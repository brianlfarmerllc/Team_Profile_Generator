  ## Description

  This Team Profile Generator is a Command Line Application that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 
  
  To iniate the application first ensure you have installed the correct packages required to run the application by running "nmp install" in the command line. Once you have the required packages, run "node app.js" in the command line to start the application. 

  The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will look in the current list of directories to see if there is currently a output directory, if not it will create one. The applicatino will then create an team.html file inside the output directory that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
